With this module it is possible to change the filename, title,
description, and location of a movie. When installed it will show up
in the movie list menu (i.e. find a movie in the movie selection list
and press the menu button) under the name "Change name...".

This version requires an Enigma2 version from later than 2008-06-28,
but should work on any Dreambox model running Enigma2.

News since version 1.1:

* It is possible to move to another location. If the other location is
  on another device, moving will be performed in the background and a
  notification given when moving is finished. The old movie will not
  disappear from the movie list until then. It is possible to request
  moving more movies before the first one has finished, but they will
  be queued up and moved after each other not the stress the external
  media too much.

* Adapted to the skin changes from 2008-04-14.
