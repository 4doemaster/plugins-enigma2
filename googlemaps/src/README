Google Maps Enigma2 Client FAQ


How to get own Placemarks into the List at Plugin Start?

You can put your own KML-File in the Root Dir of the Plugin. This is in most 
cases /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/GoogleMaps/


How the Plugin will find my custom KML-File?

The Plugin looks at Startup in his own Dir and will try to read and to display 
all Files that are ending with the Extension .kml . 


How to get a KML-File?

The Plugin uses the same KML-Files as Google Earth does it. So, if you have 
your Collection of custom Placemarks in Google Earth for Example, export them 
into a File in the Format KMZ. Rename this exported KMZ file to xxzzyy.kmz.zip 
and extract it. You will find a KML-File that will contain your Placemarks.


Why are there so much more Tags in the original KML-File from Google Earth than
in the standart KML-Files of the Plugin are?

This is because parsing unneeded Stuff costs Time we dont have :) To Speeding
up the Start of the Plugin, we have kicked of all unneeded Stuff from the 
standart KML-Files. But a original KML from Google Earth has to work too, but 
slower.


Which Tags are important for this Plugin?

This is an example of a KML-Document :
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<kml xmlns="http://earth.google.com/kml/2.2">
<Document>
	<Folder>
		<name>This is the Entry which will be shown in the Plugin Root List</name>
		<Placemark>
			<name>This is the Name of a Placemark</name>
			<LookAt>
				<longitude>13.3501</longitude>
				<latitude>52.514553</latitude>
			</LookAt>
		</Placemark>
	</Folder>
</Document>
</kml>


What I am doing, if I want some Placemarks be added to the standard Plugin 
KML-Files?

Just send me a email to 3c5x9%at%gmx.net .
